## OmniSecure: A Safety App for Women

OmniSecure is a user-end application designed to provide safety for women by enabling them to trigger SOS signals during emergencies. 

### Key Features

- **Audio Analysis**: The app detects risky words and distress calls, such as screams, and automatically triggers the SOS mechanism to notify friends and authorities.
